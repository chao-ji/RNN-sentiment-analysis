# Semi-supervised-sequence-learning

This repo documents the experiments that pretrains a Sequence Autoencoder or Language Model on unlabeled sequence data, and fine-tuning a RNN-based sequence classifier initialized with the pretrained weights. See the paper [semi-supervised-sequence-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432).
